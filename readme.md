# PCP Abschlussprojekt - python

## Project setup
To run the project on your machine use following tools:
* python version 3.7
* IDE: PyCharm

If you use python version 3.7, you can run all examples directly in IDE. With version 3.8 you probably have to run the coroutine and completabe_future example from a python console. I ran into problems while running them in PyCharm.

Have fun \m/
